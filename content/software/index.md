## Engineering Transfer Learning

Collection of transfer learning algorithms that have been generated or applied in engineering contexts, particularly for structural health monitoring, avaliable via [Github](https://github.com/pagard/EngineeringTransferLearning).

Currently models include:
- Transfer component analysis
- Joint distribution adaptation
- Balanced distribution adaptation
- Metric-informed joint distribution adaptation
- Kernelised Bayesian transfer learning
