I'm a Research Associate at the University of Sheffield, and currently involved in [DigiTwin](https://digitwin.ac.uk/), a project developing digital twins for structural dynamics applications. My interests involve combining ideas from machine learning and statistics in improving physics-based models for engineering applications.
